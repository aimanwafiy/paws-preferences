# 🐾 Paws & Preferences

Paws & Preferences is a swipe-based web application that helps users discover their favourite cats.  
Inspired by popular swipe interfaces, users can like or dislike cats and view a summary of their favourites at the end.

The app is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and uses the **Cataas (Cat as a Service) API** to fetch cat images.
